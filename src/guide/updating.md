# Updating DindeGDPS

## On Windows
It is really easy and will check updates automatically once you open the launcher. If an update is available, click on OK and then click on "Download" 
::: warning
This will not work on the Minimal Version/Web App version of the launcher.

## On Mobile versions
On the most recent versions of DindeGDPS (from V3), you can open the game and click on the DimisAIO logo (bottom left). It will open the website's web page with a version check ran in the background. If there is a new version, it will download it for your device (JavaScript is required if you disabled it).
